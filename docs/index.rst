SpinW
=====

.. rst-class:: home-intro

*SpinW* and *pySpinW* are libraries that can plot and numerically simulate
magnetic structures and excitations of a given spin Hamiltonian using
classical Monte Carlo simulation and linear spin-wave theory. SpinW and
pySpinW are written for MATLAB and Python respectively.

Features
--------

SpinW can solve the following spin Hamiltonian using classical and
quasi-classical numerical methods:

.. math::

   H = \sum_{i,j} S_i J_{ij} S_j
       + \sum_i S_i A_i S_i
       + B \sum_i g_i S_i

where :math:`S_i` are spin vector operators, :math:`J_{ij}` are 3x3 matrices
describing pair coupling between spins, :math:`A_{ij}` are 3x3 anisotropy
matrices, :math:`B` is the external magnetic field, and :math:`g_i` is the
g-tensor.
