## Help on SpinW

Use the help command to get help on any SpinW function. For any function that starts with 'sw_' use help swfiles, for spinw class methods use help spinw.function_name. For help on plotting commands, use help swplot.

### Open help files

```matlab
help swfiles

% To find the location of the spinw library use
sw_rootdir

% To open any of the functions in the Matlab editor, use
edit spinw.plot

% To look at any of the spinw object properties, double click on the
% "Workspace" view on the name of the object. Also the data files
% (symmetry.dat, atom.dat, color.dat, magion.dat) can be easily edited, for
% example

edit symmetry.dat

% Some settings are ekpt during the active Matlab session, these can be
% set/get using the swpref.setpref and swpref.getpref commands. To change
% the default values, it can be defined in the startup.m file. To get all
% current value use

swpref
```

### Generate lattice

We create a triangular lattice of magnetic atoms.

```matlab
tri = spinw;

% The lattice parameters in Angstrom and angles in degree can be defined.
tri.genlattice('lat_const',[3 3 4],'angled',[90 90 120])

% To plot the lattice use the command spinw.plot.
plot(tri)

% In the plot window, you can zoom with the mouse wheel, pan by pressing
% the Ctrl button while dragging. Change the plot range and view direction
% by pressing the corresponding buttons on the top.
```

```text
Warning: There are no atoms in the plotting range!
```

``` 

### Adding atoms

We add 1 atom at the origin of the unit cell, spin-3/2 Cr3+ ion using the spinw.addatom.

```matlab
tri.addatom('r',[0 0 0],'S',3/2,'label','MCr3')

plot(tri)
```

```{image} /_static/img/tutorials/tutorial30/tutorial30_02.png
:alt: 
``` 

### Definition of the spin-Hamiltonian

We create an antiferromagnetic first neighbor Hamiltonian plus easy plane single ion anisotropy red ellipsoids represent the single ion anistropy on the plot (equienergetic surface) examine the plot and test different values of A0 with different signs. The plot command can plot rectangular cut of the lattice setting the unit option to xyz and giving the plot range in Agnstrom.

```matlab
A0 = 0.1;

tri.addmatrix('label','J1','value',1)
tri.addmatrix('label','A','value',[0 0 0;0 0 0;0 0 A0])

tri.gencoupling

tri.addcoupling('mat','J1','bond',1)
tri.addaniso('A')

plot(tri,'range',[22 20 1/2],'unit','xyz','cellMode','single')
```

```{image} /_static/img/tutorials/tutorial30/tutorial30_03.png
:alt: 
``` 

### Magnetic structure

The ground state magnetic structure of the above Hamltonian is a spiral, with propagation vector of (1/3,1/3,0). We define the plane of the spiral as the ab plane. Careful: the given spin vector is column vector! What are the angles between neares neighbor moments?

```matlab
tri.genmagstr('mode','helical','S',[1;0;0],'k',[1/3 1/3 0],'n',[0 0 1],'nExt',[1 1 1])

plot(tri,'range',[3 3 1/2],'cellMode','inside','magColor','red')
```

```{image} /_static/img/tutorials/tutorial30/tutorial30_04.png
:alt: 
``` 

### Spin wave dispersion

We calculate the spin wave dispersion along the (H,H,0) high symmetry direction. How many spin wave modes are there and why? What does the red line mean? Did you got any warning?

```matlab
spec = tri.spinwave({[0 0 0] [1 1 0] 500},'hermit',false);

figure
sw_plotspec(spec,'mode','disp','imag',true,'colormap',[0 0 0],'colorbar',false)
axis([0 1 0 5])
```

```text
Warning: Eigenvectors of defective eigenvalues cannot be orthogonalised at some
q-point!
```

```{image} /_static/img/tutorials/tutorial30/tutorial30_05.png
:alt: 
``` 

### Spin-spin correlation functions

The spin-spin correlations is already calculated, however the result contains 9 numbers per Q-point per mode. It is not possible to show this on a single plot.

BUT!

1. we can calculate the neutron scattering cross section 2. we can select one of the components S_alpha_beta(Q,w) 3. we can sum up the diagonal S_alpha_alpha(Q,w)

What do you see? Where is the largest intensity? How is it related to the magnetic propagation vector?

Why are some modes gapped? What type of spin-spin correlations are gapped?

Why do we have Szz?

Shouldn't the spins precess around M? Shouldn't each spin wave mode corresponds to a precession in a specific plane not a motion along a specific axis?

```matlab
%spec = sw_egrid(spec,'component','Sperp','Evect',0:0.01:5.5);
spec = sw_egrid(spec,'component',{'Sxx+Syy' 'Szz'},'Evect',0:0.01:5);
%spec = sw_egrid(spec,'component','Syz','Evect',0:0.01:5);

figure
sw_plotspec(spec,'mode','color','dE',0.2,'imag',false)
hold on
axis([0 1 0 5.5])
caxis([0 3])
```

``` 

### k=0 magnetic structure

We can generate the same magnetic structure with zero propagation vector on a magnetic supercell.

Why would we do that? Not for a triangular lattice, but in more complex cases, we will have to!

You can keep the previous structure plot by pressing the red circle on the figure to compare the new magnetic structure. Is there any difference?

What are we doing here? Can you tell from the script?

Check out the tri.magstr command? What data is stored there? What are the dimensions of the different matrices?

You can also compare the energy per spin of the old magnetic structure and the new magnetic structure using the spinw.energy() function. Is there any difference?

You can also store the new magnetic structure in a separate SpinW object by first duplicating the original object using the copy() command!

What happens when we use tri2 = triNew, without the copy command?

```matlab
triNew = copy(tri);
tri2   = triNew;

triNew.genmagstr('mode','random','next',[3 3 1])
triNew.optmagsteep('nRun',1e4)
% Converged?

triNew.genmagstr('mode','rotate','n',[0 0 1])

phi1 = atan2(triNew.magstr.S(2,1),triNew.magstr.S(1,1));

triNew.genmagstr('mode','rotate','n',[0 0 1],'phi',-phi1)

plot(triNew,'range',[3 3 1],'atomLegend',false)

% How does the magnetic structures compare? Are they the same? Why?
%

tri.magstr
tri2.magstr
```

### Spin wave dispersion on the k=0 magnetic structure

We calculate the spin wave dispersion along the (H,H,0) high symmetry direction. How many modes do we have? Is there more than before? Which is the right one then?

Why are there vertical lines in the dispersion? Is it a bug?

```matlab
spec = tri.spinwave({[0 0 0] [1 1 0] 500},'hermit',false);

figure
subplot(2,1,1)
sw_plotspec(spec,'mode','disp','imag',true,'colormap',[0 0 0])

axis([0 1 0 5])

% spin-spin correlation functions
spec = sw_egrid(spec,'component','Sperp','Evect',0:0.01:5.5);

sw_plotspec(spec,'mode','color','dE',0.2,'imag',false)
